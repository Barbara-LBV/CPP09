*utiliser une inverted Polish mathematical expression
	Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a method for representing 
	expressions in which the operator symbol is placed after 
	the arguments being operated on. Polish notation, in which the 
	operator comes before the operands, was invented in the 1920s by 
	the Polish mathematician Jan Lucasiewicz.

	=> Classical expression "infix" = 3 + 4
	=> Polish notation = + 3 4 : le signe est avt les nb a additionner.
	=> Reverse Polish notation = 3 4 + : le signe est apres les nb a additionner.
